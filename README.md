Measure your impact on each segment, experiment partition, and be able to take action right-away.
No updates needed on App Store, Google Play or etc..
Do all this in real-time, and much more...
This SDK performs all necessary and possible action with SALTR REST API to connect, update, set and download data related to game's features or levels.

All data received from SALTR REST API is parsed and represented through set of instances of classes, each carrying specific objects and their properties.

Basically SDK, as the REST API, has few simple actions. The most important one is connecting getAppData(), which loads the app data objects containing features, experiments and level headers.
